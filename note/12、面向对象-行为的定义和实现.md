# 行为的定义和实现

> Is Go an object-oriented language?
Yes and no. Although Go has types and methods and allows an objectoriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy. The concept
of “interface” in Go provides a different approach that we believe is
easy to use and in some ways more general.
Also, the lack of a type hierarchy makes “objects” in Go feel much more
lightweight than in languages such as C++ or Java.
